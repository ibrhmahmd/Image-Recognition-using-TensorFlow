Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates the process of building an image classification model using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.
The goal is to classify images of flowers into different categories (daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips) using a convolutional neural network (CNN).


The project follows a structured workflow:

- Data Exploration:
    Examine and understand the dataset, which consists of 3,670 photos of flowers categorized into five classes.

- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
    Utilize TensorFlow's utilities to efficiently load the dataset from disk. Preprocess the images, including resizing and standardization.

- Model Building: 
  Construct a CNN model using the tf.keras.Sequential API. The model consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers,
      dropout layers for regularization, and fully connected layers.

- Model Training: 
    Train the model on the training dataset, evaluating its performance on the validation set.
    Monitor training progress using checkpoints and visualize training metrics such as accuracy and loss.

- Model Evaluation:
    Assess the model's performance on the validation set and identify potential overfitting.

- Data Augmentation:
    Mitigate overfitting by applying data augmentation techniques, such as random flips, rotations, and zooms, to generate additional training data.

- Model Optimization: 
    Fine-tune the model and optimize its hyperparameters for better performance.

- Model Deployment and Inference: 
    Save the trained model to disk and utilize it to classify new images that were not part of the training or validation sets.

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides a detailed walkthrough of each step, along with code snippets, visualizations, and explanations. Additionally,
it contains terminal commands for installing necessary libraries and downloading the dataset. The README file in the GitHub repository summarizes the project,
provides instructions for running the notebook, and includes relevant links and resources.
